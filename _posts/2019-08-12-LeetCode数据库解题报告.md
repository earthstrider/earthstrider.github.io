### 175. Combine Two Tables

注意左连接关键字是LEFT JOIN...ON...，不是LEFT JOIN...WHERE...

```mysql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State 
FROM Person
LEFT JOIN Address 
ON Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId;
```





### 176. Second Highest Salary

常用的聚合函数：MAX、MIN、AVG、SUM、COUNT

方法一：嵌套

```mysql
SELECT MAX(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary)
                FROM Employee);
```

方法二： 排序

```mysql
SELECT MAX(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
where Salary < (SELECT Salary 
                FROM Employee
                ORDER BY Salary DESC
                LIMIT 1);
```





### 177. Nth Highest Salary

- LIMIT有两个参数 LIMIT offset, count 
- 函数的返回用 RETURNS
- 此题需要使用 GROUP BY，相同的值次位也相同

```mysql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN

DECLARE m INT;
SET m = n-1;

	RETURN (
        SELECT Salary
        FROM Employee
        GROUP BY Salary
				ORDER BY Salary DESC
    		LIMIT m, 1
    );
END
```

![image-20190813093402093](http://ww4.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79ly1g5xssn0pjbj30ev06wmyf.jpg)

```mysql
SELECT tb1.Score, (
                SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT tb2.Score)+1
                FROM Scores as tb2
                WHERE tb2.Score > tb1.Score
                ) as Rank
FROM Scores as tb1
ORDER BY tb1.Score DESC;
```





### 180. Consecutive Numbers

自连接

```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT tb1.Num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs AS tb1, Logs as tb2, Logs as tb3
WHERE tb1.Id + 1 = tb2.Id AND tb2.Id + 1 = tb3.Id AND tb1.Num = tb2.Num AND tb2.Num = tb3.Num; 
```





### 181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

连接两个表

```mysql
SELECT tb1.Name as Employee
FROM Employee as tb1, Employee as tb2
WHERE tb1.ManagerId = tb2.Id AND tb1.Salary > tb2. Salary;
```





### 182. Duplicate Emails

方法一：分组

```mysql
SELECT Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY Email
HAVING COUNT(Email) > 1;
```

方法二：内连接

```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT tb1.Email
FROM Person as tb1
INNER JOIN Person as tb2
ON tb1.Email = tb2.Email AND tb1.id != tb2.id;
```
